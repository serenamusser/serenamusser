## About Me 🙋‍♀️
Hello! I'm Serena. I'm currently a Shopkeeper at IKEA, where I manage the Living Room department's operations and lead a dedicated team to success. In addition to my role at IKEA, I'm pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Web and Mobile Applications at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I'm set to graduate in December 2024.

I have a passion for technology and leadership, and I enjoy bringing these two worlds together. My programming skills span several languages, including Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, HTML/CSS, SQL, and more. I'm always eager to learn new things and take on challenges that help me grow both personally and professionally.

## Projects 👾
### 1. Overdrive 🎮
A simple top-down 2D endless-runner racing game created in Unity. This project was a fun exploration into game development, where I combined my love for gaming with programming.

### 2. FastAPI 👩‍💻
A basic implementation of an API using the FastAPI framework. This project allowed me to dive into backend development, focusing on creating fast and efficient APIs.

### 3. Assignment 5 👩‍💻
A more in-depth API implementation utilizing FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PyMySQL, and Pytest. This project was a significant step in enhancing my backend development skills, particularly in database management and testing.

## Goals 🎯
- **Continuous Learning:** I am committed to growing my knowledge in the field of computer science. There’s always something new to learn, and I embrace every opportunity to expand my skill set.
- **Career Discovery:** My goal is to find a career that combines my passion for computer science with my leadership experience. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to lead teams and innovate within the tech industry.
